Phoning it in this week (hey, moving’s stressful) with something of a previously-on: here’s my first-place entry for the Wellesley English Department translation contest. Sharp-eyed readers will note a continuing dialogue with my first blog post here, but I’ll let the treatment speak for itself…

> ‘But I am Love, and I was wont to be\
Alone in this fair garden, till he came\
Unasked by night; I am true Love, I fill\
The hearts of boy and girl with mutual flame.’\
Then sighing, said the other, ‘Have thy will,\
I am the love that dare not speak its name.’ ²\

-- Alfred Douglas, “Two Loves” (1892)
