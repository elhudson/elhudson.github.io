Ille mi par esse deo videtur,
ille, si fas est, superare divos,
qui sedens adversus identidem te
spectat et audit

dulce ridentem, misero quod omnes
eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te,
Lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi
<vocis in ore>

lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus
flamma demanat, sonitu suopte
tintinant aures, gemina teguntur
lumina nocte.

otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est:
otio exsultas nimiumque gestis:
otium et reges prius et beatas
perdidit urbes.

translation={`
He seems like unto a god to me— dare I say it,
he seems even to surpass the gods,
sitting near and seeing,
and knowing sweetly

you laughing, and o poor man I
it tears all that is sense from me:
for I see you, Lesbia, and nothing beside remains—
<all speech dead & buried.>

My tongue stills, & light sweet fire
races below my skin, & my ears— they ring
with selfsame sound, as twin flames
extinguished by night.

(Lack, Catullus, is dreadful for you:
you sense its pleasure, and you wear it oftener
than you ought.
Lack, o Catullus, lack has ruined before you great kings
& cities of the blessed.)
