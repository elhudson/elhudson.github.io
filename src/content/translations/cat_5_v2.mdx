Ille mi par esse deo videtur,
ille, si fas est, superare divos,
qui sedens adversus identidem te
spectat et audit

dulce ridentem, misero quod omnes
eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te,
Lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi
<vocis in ore;>

lingua sed torpet, tenuis sub artus
flamma demanat, sonitu suopte
tintinant aures, gemina teguntur
lumina nocte.

otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est:
otio exsultas nimiumque gestis:
otium et reges prius et beatas
perdidit urbes.

translation={`
He seems unto a god to me— I know, I shouldn’t, but 
he seems beyond the gods,
sitting near (near!) and gazing 
and knowing sweetly

your honey-laughing, and o poor woman I³
it tears the sense away from me
because when I see you (from afar), Lesbia,⁴
nothing beside remains—
<all speech dead & buried.>⁵

See here: my tongue stills, & sweet pale fire
sings below my skin, & my ears— they ring
with selfsame sound, like twin flames
extinguished in the night.

(Lack, O poetess, is your vice:
sweetbitter⁶  pleasure, you know it oftener 
than you ought.
Lack, darling, lack has ruined before you great kings
& cities of the blessed.)

footnotes={`
¹ Catullus 31 is a near-exact translation of an earlier Greek lyric by the poetess Sappho: poem 51, or φαινεται μοι. First and foremost of the Latin neoteric poets, Catullus revered Sappho as his primary model in the writing of elegiac love poetry.
² “The love that dare not speak its name” is most famous as a euphemism for homosexuality, cited in court during the trial of Oscar Wilde. Alfred “Bosie” Douglas was one of Wilde’s lovers.
³ Catullus was a male poet; that historical fact is not in question. I have here chosen to render the speaker as female for a number of reasons, but it should be noted in contrast to the Latin text.
⁴ The pseudonym for Catullus’ beloved, Lesbia, is a reference to Sappho’s home on the Greek island of Lesbos— the same attribution which gives us the modern term “lesbian” for a female homosexual.
⁵ This line is sometimes included and sometimes ommitted from the Latin text, due to a presumable manuscript corruption.
⁶ A term borrowed from Anne Carson’s translations of Sappho in If Not, Winter.
