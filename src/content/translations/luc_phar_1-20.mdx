Bella per Emathios plus quam civilia campos
Iusque datum sceleri canimus, populumque potentem
In sua victrici conversum viscera dextra,
Cognatasque acies, et rupto foedere regni,
Certatum totis concussi viribus orbis
In commune nefas, infestisque obvia signis
Signa, pares aquilas, et pila minantia pilis.

Quis furor, o cives, quae tanta licentia ferri,
Gentibus invisis Latium praebere cruorem?
Cumque superba foret Babylon spolianda tropaeis
Ausoniis, umbraque erraret Crassus inulta,
Bella geri placuit nullos habitura triumphos?

translation={`
O wars worse than civil
I sing, and worlds turned upside down,
and a nation who tore ourselves apart,
selfsame guts speared upon our swords.
O joined battle I sing, and province broken by shattered treaty,
and ruin of ruins unspeakable, together see: standard against standard,
eagle to eagle, spear on spear.

O God what rage, you happy few, you band of brothersâ€” what horror
could bear you to succor our enemies on blood?
When (o God, o God) proud Babylon lay wanting before you,
all glories unwed, and the unquiet dead hungered yet?
Here's the thing, O citizens: that's no war you're fighting.
