Tu, qui consortem properas evadere casum,
miles ab Etruscis saucius aggeribus,
quid nostro gemitu turgentia lumina torques?
pars ego sum vestrae proxima militiae.
sic te servato ut possint gaudere parentes,
et soror acta tuis sentiat e lacrimis:
Gallum per medios ereptum Caesaris ensis
effugere ignotas non potuisse manus;
et quaecumque super dispersa invenerit ossa
montibus Etruscis, haec sciat esse mea.

translation={`
You, who make haste to evade our shared fortune,
a wounded soldier from Etrurian country,
why do you turn your eyes away from our groaning?
I am a near part of your unit.
Preserve yourself, so that your parents might rejoice,
and so that your sister, made so by your tears, thinks
that Gallus, pierced by the swords of Caesar
amidst hostile forces, was not able to flee;
and when she should find these bones, scattered
across the Etrurian mountainsâ€” she'll know they were mine.
