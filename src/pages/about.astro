          Hi! My name's El. I'm a writer, tutor, and computer programmer, with
          expertise in web development and computational data analysis. In
          college I studied ancient history for two years before discovering
          that I loved to code, and I'm really interested in applying
          quantitative methods to social, historical and literary questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was born in Texas, but I moved to Boston to attend college at
          Wellesley in 2018. I graduated with a degree in Classics in 2023,
          after four years plus a gap year working in educational policy at the
          Archdiocese of San Antonio. These days I live in Greater Boston and
          work in a local school system. When I'm not doing that, I like to
          read, write, watch movies and TV, and play tabletop games with my
          friends.
